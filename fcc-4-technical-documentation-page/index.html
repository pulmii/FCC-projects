             <p>JavaScript and Java are similar in some ways but fundamentally different in some others. The JavaScript language resembles Java but does not have Java's static typing and strong type checking. JavaScript follows most Java expression syntax, naming conventions and basic control-flow constructs which was the reason why it was renamed from LiveScript to JavaScript.</p>

<p>In contrast to Java's compile-time system of classes built by declarations, JavaScript supports a runtime system based on a small number of data types representing numeric, Boolean, and string values. JavaScript has a prototype-based object model instead of the more common class-based object model. The prototype-based model provides dynamic inheritance; that is, what is inherited can vary for individual objects. JavaScript also supports functions without any special declarative requirements. Functions can be properties of objects, executing as loosely typed methods.</p>

<p>JavaScript is a very free-form language compared to Java. You do not have to declare all variables, classes, and methods. You do not have to be concerned with whether methods are public, private, or protected, and you do not have to implement interfaces. Variables, parameters, and function return types are not explicitly typed.</p>

              <p>React has been designed from the start for gradual adoption, and you can use as little or as much React as you need. Whether you want to get a taste of React, add some interactivity to a simple HTML page, or start a complex React-powered app, the links in this section will help you get started.</p>
              <h4>Online Playgrounds</h4>
              <li>If you’re interested in playing around with React, you can use an online code playground</li>
              <li>Try a Hello World template on CodePen or CodeSandbox.</li>
<li>If you prefer to use your own text editor, you can also download this HTML file, edit it, and open it from the local filesystem in your browser. It does a slow runtime code transformation, so we’d only recommend using this for simple demos.</li></p>
 <br />             
<h4>Add React to a Website</h4>
              <li>You can add React to an HTML page in one minute. You can then either gradually expand its presence, or keep it contained to a few dynamic widgets.</li>
            </article>

            <p>People come to React from different backgrounds and with different learning styles. Whether you prefer a more theoretical or a practical approach, we hope you’ll find this section helpful.</p>

<p>If you prefer to learn by doing, start with our practical tutorial.
If you prefer to learn concepts step by step, start with our guide to main concepts.
Like any unfamiliar technology, React does have a learning curve. With practice and some patience, you will get the hang of it.</p>
            
            <h4>First Examples</h4>
            <p><a href="https://reactjs.org/" alt="React.js">The React homepage</a> contains a few small React examples with a live editor. Even if you don’t know anything about React yet, try changing their code and see how it affects the result.</p>
            
            <h4>React for Beginners</h4>
            <li>If you feel that the React documentation goes at a faster pace than you’re comfortable with, check out <a href="https://www.taniarascia.com/getting-started-with-react/">this overview of React by Tania Rascia.</a> It introduces the most important React concepts in a detailed, beginner-friendly way. Once you’re done, give the documentation another try!</li>
            <br />
            
            <h4>React for Designers</h4>
            <li>
              If you’re coming from a design background, these resources are a great place to get started.</li>
            <br />
            <h4>JavaScript Resources</h4>
            <p>The React documentation assumes some familiarity with programming in the JavaScript language. You don’t have to be an expert, but it’s harder to learn both React and JavaScript at the same time.</p>

<p>We recommend going through this JavaScript overview to check your knowledge level. It will take you between 30 minutes and an hour but you will feel more confident learning React.</p>

            <p>The React blog is the official source for the updates from the React team. Anything important, including release notes or deprecation notices, will be posted there first.</p>

<p>You can also follow the @reactjs account on Twitter, but you won’t miss anything essential if you only read the blog.</p>

<p>Not every React release deserves its own blog post, but you can find a detailed changelog for every release in the CHANGELOG.md file in the React repository, as well as on the Releases page.</p>

            <hr>
            <p>This documentation always reflects the latest stable version of React. Since React 16, you can find older versions of the documentation on a separate page. Note that documentation for past versions is snapshotted at the time of the release, and isn’t being continuously updated.</p>
            
            <code>if (true) {

            <br />
 <p>React has been designed from the start for gradual adoption, and you can use as little or as much React as you need. Perhaps you only want to add some “sprinkles of interactivity” to an existing page. React components are a great way to do that.</p>
            
<code>if (true) {
  let y = 5;
}
console.log(y);  
// ReferenceError: y is not defined</code>
            
<p>The majority of websites aren’t, and don’t need to be, single-page apps. With a few lines of code and no build tooling, try React in a small part of your website. You can then either gradually expand its presence, or keep it contained to a few dynamic widgets.</p>
            
            <code>if (true) {
  let y = 5;
}
console.log(y);  
// ReferenceError: y is not defined</code>

            <p>In this section, we will show how to add a React component to an existing HTML page. You can follow along with your own website, or create an empty HTML file to practice.</p>

<p>There will be no complicated tools or install requirements — to complete this section, you only need an internet connection, and a minute of your time.</p>
            <br />
            First, open the HTML page you want to edit. Add an empty < div > tag to mark the spot where you want to display something with React. For example:
            <code>if (true) {
  let y = 5;
}
console.log(y);  
// ReferenceError: y is not defined</code>
          </section>
